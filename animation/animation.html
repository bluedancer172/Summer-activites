Animation!

<h3 style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> I decided to try something new while we were stuck at home, in the form of animation! I'm not the best at it yet but I'm hoping with some practice and tutorials I might get better, because I really enjoy doing it! :D </h3>

<p> This isn't really a "summer" activity, however, since I started doing it in the summer + it's something that you can try out and have fun with, I'm still going to 
count it! This is more of an indoor activity but still a fun summer activity to try out nonetheless. </p>

<p> Animation isn't really something that's neccesarily...easy. The concept is pretty easy to understand and not too hard to grasp, however animation is quite 
time-consuming. This is why this makes it a perfect activity for me, since I don't have a lot to do. Sure, it does mean you have to spend a lot more time on a screen 
(Depending on whether you use a phone, laptop, tablet, etc.), however it is definently something that can easily keep you intrested. Plus most animation apps 
(Such as the one I use- Flipaclip), don't need Wifi+the basic forms come for free, so it's something you can do on the go or if your wifi goes out. 
Plus, at the end you get spectacular results you can feel proud of and show your friends + family. </p>

<p> It can also give you practice with drawing + body poses + emotions. Animation uses different postures + facial expressions to help convey emotions better, and 
practicing with animation can definently help with potraying emotions better! </p>
