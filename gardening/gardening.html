<h1> Gardening </h1>
<h3> One thing that my family and I have been able to do since we've moved to a new house is gardening. However, while it was winter/fall and it was colder, we weren't 
able to do much.Now that it is warmer outside, we were able to garden a lot more. We have a lot of plants in our garden, including: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Snakeguard/Longuard </li>
<li> Tomatoes </li>
<li> Mint </li>
<li> Peppers/Chilis </li>
</ul>

<h3> And a lot more. While I don't really help around with the garden a lot, it's still amazing to watch all the plants grow. We also eat food cooked from the vegetables
we grow (of course) which really brings it into perspective. </h3>

<h4> Gardening doesn't really have to be a summer activity, you technically do it year-round (If you're taking care of plants that last long). However, near the spring/summer
time you are able to harvest them, but you also have to be careful because there are always little critters who want those crops for themselves! >:D </h4>
